# Welcome to my website

This repo is for my personal website. The puropse of my site is two-sided: 
- Have a plave to showcase my photography and other projects I want to share with the world.
- A side project that allows me to test and learn different techniques and designs in web development

For the latter I have set a rule to try avoid using third party packages as often as possible. This mainly applies to the frontend part of the page as this is my main area of interest. 

## Specs
- React
- Webpack
- Firebase
- CSS + PostCSS
- react-router-dom
